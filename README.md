# üéì Attendance Percentage Calculator

This is a simple Python script that calculates student attendance percentages from raw attendance records and assigns marks based on predefined rules.

## üìã Features

* Reads attendance data from an embedded CSV string.
* Calculates attendance percentage per student.
* Assigns marks based on attendance percentage:

  * `5 marks` ‚Üí 70% and above
  * `4 marks` ‚Üí 60% to less than 70%
  * `3 marks` ‚Üí 45% to less than 60%
  * `2 marks` ‚Üí Less than 45%
* Prints a formatted attendance report.
* Shows a summary of how many students fall into each attendance category.

## üì¶ Requirements

This script uses the following Python libraries:

* `pandas`
* `io.StringIO`
* (Optional) `tabulate` (for better markdown-style table display in terminal)

Install dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install pandas tabulate
```

> Note: The script will fallback to basic printing if `tabulate` is not installed.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

### Run the script

```bash
python attendance_calculator.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of students to calculate attendance for:

* Enter a **number** to limit the results (e.g., `5` to process the first 5 students).
* Press **Enter** without typing anything to calculate for **all students**.

### Example Output

```
Please enter the Number of Students (or press Enter for all): 5
